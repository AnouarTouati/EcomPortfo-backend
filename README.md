## About

I am buldibng this Laravel REST API backend to help me in my journey to learn React ecosystem.

Why Laravel ? because I used it professionally for 2 years and is what's I am most comfortable with.

**[The React project consuming this backend is here](https://github.com/AnouarTouati/EcomPortfo-frontend)**

### TO-DO

-   [x] Carry Cart over when a user signs/up in and merge with the existing one.
-   [ ] Send order confirmation email.
-   [ ] Make product creation streamlined by communicating with Stripe so the admin donesn't have to visit the Stripe dashboard at all.
